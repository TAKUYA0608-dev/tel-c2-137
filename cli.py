"""Marketplace Pod entrypoint — one-shot process, referenced by the Dockerfile CMD.

Template-owned (the scaffold ships a blueprint with placeholders): it targets
this template's own Graph rather than the blueprint's ChatAgent.

The runner passes `config` straight through to `agent_cls(config=...)`, so
`config/config.yaml` reaches the agent instead of the agent being constructed
bare and running on framework defaults without saying so. Both wheels a
deployment can carry support this: the vendored 1.0.1 the CoE deploy tool
installs, and agentcore 1.0.2 from the package registry (measured on both).

The import of `shared.bootstrap` stays inside `main()`: it ships in the wheel
only with the `[marketplace]` extra, so a local environment installed without
that extra can still import this module (test collection must not depend on the
extra being present).

    The sidecar (HTTPS_PROXY=127.0.0.1:15001) can begin accepting connections
    after this container's process starts, so any outbound call issued in that
    window never leaves the pod. Which wheel this template runs
    on is decided when the image is built, not here, and the two differ:
    agentcore 1.0.2's ``marketplace_app`` awaits this itself, while the vendored
    1.0.1 the CoE deploy tool installs does not. Keeping the wait template-side
    is correct for both — on 1.0.2 it is a second call that the sidecar has
    already satisfied and which returns at once; on 1.0.1 it is the only one.

    Fail-open by construction: if the helper is absent or raises, the run
    continues rather than aborting, because the worst case is exactly the
    pre-wait behaviour the fleet already ships. ``wait_for_egress`` bounds
    itself at 15s and logs its own warning on timeout.
